# DataJourney

## Background

DataJourney is intended to be a fun and interactive exploratory interface where users
can see the start-to-finish process of data pipelines. This summer I spent my time working within a
Data Management department. Not only did I learn a variety of skills, but I also made an interesting
discovery. Data pipelines are an essential component to the success and efficiency of business. They
often require consistent maintenance and modifications to meet fluctuating needs and tackle new
problems. That is, data pipelines are frequently overlooked by industry beginners and students,
despite their importance. But don’t take it from me, take it from professionals in the field. Consider
an article centered around the needs and challenges of well-designed pipelines. They begin this
discussion by stating that "Most of these barriers manifest in data cleaning and merging, and require
a data engineer to support some parts of the analysis." [1]. This study goes on to express growing
issues and challenges that exist within this realm, especially as more and more data flows into the
world of business. Consider also the job market surronding data engineers (who are often responsible
for the creation, maintenance, and modification of pipelines). 365 Data Science states that this field
employs around "...150,000 professionals, and it added over 20,000 new jobs in the past year."[2].
All that is to say that these articles provide an excellent real-world perspective and supporting reasons
for an application like DataJourney.
